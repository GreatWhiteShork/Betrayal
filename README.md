Digital "Betrayal at House on the Hill" Character Cards

For the board game 'Betrayal at House on the Hill', the character cards that come with it have stats to keep track of.
They're tracked by placing pegs around the edges that point at your number.
The problem is it's often tricky to tell which one it's pointing at.
Plenty of people have made custom alternate pegs to make it easier to tell.

I thought it would be a nice exercise to try create a digital one.
It runs using the Lottie library, which allows me to really customise the animations and designs in AE.

Code is all messy. For me the goal is just to get this system to work nicely.

Designed in Illustrator.
Animated and Set Up in After Effects.
Exported with Bodymovin / Lottie.
